A collection of algorithmic problems solved in Python.

These problems were solved as part of the Coursera [Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms) from the University of California, San Diego and National Research University Higher School of Economics.

Each directory corresponds to a course and each subdirectory corresponds to an assignment within the course. These subdirectories have a PDF document with the assignment questions along with a series of `.py` files serving as answers to these questions
